If you make changes to your Vite React app and want to deploy those changes to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes

1. **Stage Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update: Description of changes"
   ```

### Step 2: Build the Project

Run the build command to create a new `dist` folder with your updated files:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Updated App

Finally, deploy the updated app to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Summary of Commands

Here’s a quick recap of the commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Description of changes"
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Access Your App

After deploying, your changes should be live at:
```
https://<username>.github.io
```

### Additional Notes

- **Check the `gh-pages` Branch**: If you want to verify that your changes have been pushed, you can check the `gh-pages` branch in your GitHub repository.
- **Wait for Changes to Appear**: Sometimes it may take a few minutes for changes to reflect on GitHub Pages. If you don’t see them immediately, try refreshing your browser or clearing the cache.
